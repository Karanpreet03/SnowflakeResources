## 🏗️ Architecture Deep Dive

Snowflake's **multi-cluster, shared data architecture** is what makes it special. Here's how it works:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Services Layer"
        A[Query Processing] --> B[Metadata Management]
        B --> C[Security & Access Control]
        C --> D[Transaction Management]
    end
    
    subgraph "Compute Layer"
        E[Virtual Warehouse 1] --> F[Virtual Warehouse 2]
        F --> G[Virtual Warehouse N]
    end
    
    subgraph "Storage Layer"
        H[Structured Data] --> I[Semi-Structured Data]
        I --> J[Encrypted & Compressed]
    end
    
    A --> E
    E --> H
```

### 🔧 Architecture Components

#### 1. **Storage Layer** 🗄️
- **What it does**: Stores all data with automatic compression and encryption
- **Key benefits**: 
  - Infinite scalability
  - Cross-region replication
  - Automatic optimization
- **Best practices**: 
  - Use clustering keys for large tables (>1TB)
  - Leverage semi-structured data features

#### 2. **Compute Layer** ⚙️
- **What it does**: Processes queries using virtual warehouses
- **Sizing options**:
  ```
  XS:   1 server,  8 cores  → Light workloads
  S:    2 servers, 16 cores → Standard queries  
  M:    4 servers, 32 cores → Medium workloads
  L:    8 servers, 64 cores → Heavy analytics
  XL:   16 servers           → Very large datasets
  2XL+: Up to 512 servers    → Extreme workloads
  ```

#### 3. **Services Layer** 🛠️
- **Query optimization**: Automatic query planning
- **Metadata management**: Schema, statistics, access control
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, audit logging

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 📊 Database Objects Hierarchy

```
Account
├── Database
│   ├── Schema
│   │   ├── Tables
│   │   ├── Views
│   │   ├── Stored Procedures
│   │   └── User-Defined Functions
│   └── Stages (Internal/External)
└── Warehouses
```

### 🏭 Virtual Warehouses

Virtual warehouses are **compute clusters** that execute your queries. Think of them as the "engines" of your data processing.

```sql
-- Create a warehouse
CREATE WAREHOUSE analytics_wh WITH
    WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'MEDIUM'
    AUTO_SUSPEND = 300        -- Suspend after 5 minutes
    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE        -- Resume automatically
    INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = TRUE;

-- Resize on demand
ALTER WAREHOUSE analytics_wh SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'LARGE';
```

### ⏰ Time Travel & Fail-Safe

One of Snowflake's most powerful features for data recovery:

```sql
-- Query data from 1 hour ago
SELECT * FROM my_table AT (OFFSET => -3600);

-- Query data from specific timestamp
SELECT * FROM my_table AT (TIMESTAMP => '2024-01-01 12:00:00'::timestamp);

-- Restore accidentally deleted data
CREATE TABLE my_table_restored CLONE my_table AT (OFFSET => -1800);
```

**Time Travel Retention:**
- Standard tables: 1 day (configurable up to 90 days)
- Fail-safe: Additional 7 days (Snowflake-only recovery)

### 🗂️ Stages & Data Loading

Stages are **named locations** for storing data files:

```sql
-- Create internal stage
CREATE STAGE my_internal_stage;

-- Create external stage (S3 example)
CREATE STAGE my_s3_stage
    URL = 's3://my-bucket/data/'
    CREDENTIALS = (AWS_KEY_ID = 'xxx' AWS_SECRET_KEY = 'yyy');

-- Load data
COPY INTO my_table
FROM @my_s3_stage/file.csv
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' FIELD_DELIMITER = ',' SKIP_HEADER = 1);
```

        customer_id,
        touchpoint_type,
        channel,
        campaign_id,
        cost,
        -- Time-decay attribution (more recent = higher weight)
        EXP(-DATEDIFF('hour', touchpoint_time, conversion_time) / 24.0) AS weight
    FROM customer_touchpoints ct
    JOIN conversions c ON ct.customer_id = c.customer_id
)

        AVG(purchase_amount) AS avg_order_value
    FROM monthly_cohorts
    GROUP BY cohort_month, period_number
)

SELECT 
    cohort_month,
    period_number,
    customers,
    revenue,
    avg_order_value,
    revenue / LAG(customers) OVER (
        PARTITION BY cohort_month 
        ORDER BY period_number
    ) AS revenue_per_customer
FROM cohort_data
ORDER BY cohort_month, period_number;
```

#### 3. **Real-Time Campaign Optimization** 📊

```sql
-- Hourly campaign performance monitoring
CREATE TASK campaign_performance_monitor
    WAREHOUSE = analytics_wh
    SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 * * * * UTC'  -- Every hour
AS
INSERT INTO campaign_alerts
SELECT 
    campaign_id,
    channel,
    current_timestamp AS alert_time,
    'HIGH_CPA' AS alert_type,
    cost_per_acquisition,
    target_cpa
FROM (
    SELECT 
        campaign_id,
        channel,
        SUM(cost) / NULLIF(SUM(conversions), 0) AS cost_per_acquisition,
        MAX(target_cpa) AS target_cpa
    FROM hourly_campaign_metrics
    WHERE date_hour >= DATEADD('hour', -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    GROUP BY campaign_id, channel
) 
WHERE cost_per_acquisition > target_cpa * 1.2;  -- 20% over target
```

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### 🚀 Query Optimization

#### 1. **Use Clustering Keys**
```sql
-- For large tables (>1TB), clustering improves performance
ALTER TABLE large_campaign_data CLUSTER BY (date_key, campaign_id);

-- Monitor clustering effectiveness
SELECT 
    table_name,
    clustering_key,
    total_constant_percent,
    average_overlaps
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.AUTOMATIC_CLUSTERING_HISTORY
WHERE table_name = 'LARGE_CAMPAIGN_DATA';
```

#### 2. **Optimize JOIN Operations**
```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Use specific columns in SELECT
SELECT 
    c.campaign_id,
    c.campaign_name,
    SUM(m.cost) AS total_cost
FROM campaigns c
JOIN metrics m ON c.campaign_id = m.campaign_id
WHERE c.status = 'ACTIVE'
GROUP BY c.campaign_id, c.campaign_name;

-- ❌ AVOID: SELECT * with large JOINs
SELECT *
FROM campaigns c
JOIN metrics m ON c.campaign_id = m.campaign_id;
```

#### 3. **Leverage Result Caching**
```sql
-- Enable result caching for repeated queries
ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;

-- Check cache hit rates
SELECT 
    query_id,
    query_text,
    warehouse_name,
    execution_time,
    bytes_scanned,
    result_cache_hit
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE result_cache_hit = TRUE
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 💰 Cost Optimization

#### 1. **Warehouse Management**
```sql
-- Create cost-optimized warehouses
CREATE WAREHOUSE ETL_WH WITH
    WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'LARGE'
    AUTO_SUSPEND = 60          -- Suspend after 1 minute
    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE
    MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1
    MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 3      -- Multi-cluster for concurrency
    SCALING_POLICY = 'STANDARD';

-- Monitor warehouse usage
SELECT 
    warehouse_name,
    SUM(credits_used) AS total_credits,
    AVG(credits_used_compute) AS avg_compute_credits,
    SUM(credits_used) * 3 AS estimated_cost_usd  -- Approximate
FROM WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
WHERE start_time >= DATEADD('day', -30, CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY warehouse_name
ORDER BY total_credits DESC;
```

#### 2. **Storage Optimization**
```sql
-- Use transient tables for staging data
CREATE TRANSIENT TABLE staging_data (...);

-- Monitor storage costs
SELECT 
    table_name,
    active_bytes / (1024*1024*1024) AS active_gb,
    time_travel_bytes / (1024*1024*1024) AS time_travel_gb,
    failsafe_bytes / (1024*1024*1024) AS failsafe_gb,
    (active_bytes + time_travel_bytes + failsafe_bytes) / (1024*1024*1024) AS total_gb
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS
WHERE schema_name = 'CAMPAIGN_DATA'
ORDER BY total_gb DESC;
```

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### 👥 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

```sql
-- Create role hierarchy
CREATE ROLE analyst_role;
CREATE ROLE senior_analyst_role;
CREATE ROLE data_admin_role;

-- Grant role hierarchy
GRANT ROLE analyst_role TO ROLE senior_analyst_role;
GRANT ROLE senior_analyst_role TO ROLE data_admin_role;

-- Grant database permissions
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE marketing_analytics TO ROLE analyst_role;
GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE marketing_analytics TO ROLE analyst_role;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE marketing_analytics TO ROLE analyst_role;

-- Grant warehouse permissions
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE analytics_wh TO ROLE analyst_role;

-- Create user and assign role
CREATE USER john_analyst 
    PASSWORD = 'StrongPassword123!'
    DEFAULT_ROLE = analyst_role
    MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = TRUE;
    
GRANT ROLE analyst_role TO USER john_analyst;
```

### 🔒 Data Protection

```sql
-- Row Access Policies
CREATE ROW ACCESS POLICY campaign_region_policy AS (region_column) RETURNS BOOLEAN ->
    CASE 
        WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('DATA_ADMIN_ROLE') THEN TRUE
        WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'US_ANALYST_ROLE' AND region_column = 'US' THEN TRUE
        WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'EU_ANALYST_ROLE' AND region_column = 'EU' THEN TRUE
        ELSE FALSE
    END;

-- Apply policy to table
ALTER TABLE campaign_data ADD ROW ACCESS POLICY campaign_region_policy ON (region);

-- Dynamic Data Masking
CREATE MASKING POLICY email_mask AS (val STRING) RETURNS STRING ->
    CASE 
        WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('DATA_ADMIN_ROLE', 'SENIOR_ANALYST_ROLE') THEN val
        ELSE REGEXP_REPLACE(val, '.+\@', '*****@')
    END;

-- Apply masking policy
ALTER TABLE customers MODIFY COLUMN email SET MASKING POLICY email_mask;
```

### 🛡️ Network Security

```sql
-- Create network policy
CREATE NETWORK POLICY corporate_network_policy
    ALLOWED_IP_LIST = ('192.168.1.0/24', '10.0.0.0/8')
    BLOCKED_IP_LIST = ('192.168.1.100');

-- Apply to account
ALTER ACCOUNT SET NETWORK_POLICY = corporate_network_policy;

-- Clone at specific point in time
CREATE TABLE campaign_data_yesterday CLONE campaign_data 
    AT (TIMESTAMP => DATEADD('day', -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()));

-- Test changes without affecting production
UPDATE campaign_data_test SET status = 'PAUSED' WHERE campaign_id = 'CAMP_001';
-- Original table remains unchanged!
```

#### 2. **Dynamic SQL for Flexible Queries**
```sql
-- Create reusable stored procedure
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE generate_campaign_report(
    date_range STRING,
    channels ARRAY
)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE SQL
AS
$$
DECLARE
    query_sql STRING;
    result_cursor CURSOR FOR query_sql;
BEGIN
    -- Build dynamic query
    query_sql := 'SELECT campaign_id, channel, SUM(cost) as total_cost, SUM(conversions) as total_conversions FROM campaign_data WHERE date_key >= DATEADD(''day'', -' || date_range || ', CURRENT_DATE) AND channel IN (''' || ARRAY_TO_STRING(channels, ''',''') || ''') GROUP BY campaign_id, channel ORDER BY total_cost DESC';
    
    -- Execute and return results
    OPEN result_cursor FOR query_sql;
    RETURN 'Report generated successfully';
END;
$$;

-- Call the procedure
CALL generate_campaign_report('7', ARRAY_CONSTRUCT('Google', 'Facebook', 'TikTok'));
```

#### 3. **Advanced Window Functions**
```sql
-- Running totals and percentiles
SELECT 
    campaign_id,
    date_key,
    daily_cost,
    -- Running total
    SUM(daily_cost) OVER (
        PARTITION BY campaign_id 
        ORDER BY date_key 
        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
    ) AS running_total,
    -- Moving average (7-day)
    AVG(daily_cost) OVER (
        PARTITION BY campaign_id 
        ORDER BY date_key 
        ROWS 6 PRECEDING
    ) AS moving_avg_7d,
    -- Percentile ranking
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC('month', date_key)
        ORDER BY daily_cost
    ) AS cost_percentile
FROM campaign_daily_metrics
ORDER BY campaign_id, date_key;
```

#### 4. **Smart Data Sampling**
```sql
-- Use SAMPLE for large dataset analysis
SELECT 
    channel,
    AVG(cost_per_click) as avg_cpc,
    COUNT(*) as sample_size
FROM campaign_data SAMPLE (10 ROWS)  -- Sample 10 rows
GROUP BY channel;

-- Percentage-based sampling
SELECT 
    campaign_type,
    MEDIAN(conversion_rate) as median_cvr
FROM campaign_data SAMPLE (1)  -- Sample 1% of data
WHERE date_key >= DATEADD('month', -1, CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY campaign_type;
```

### 🔧 Hidden Gems

#### 1. **QUALIFY Clause (Better than HAVING)**
```sql
-- ✅ Use QUALIFY instead of subqueries
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    order_value,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) as rn
FROM orders
QUALIFY rn = 1;  -- Get latest order per customer

-- ❌ Old way with subquery
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        order_date,
        order_value,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) as rn
    FROM orders
) WHERE rn = 1;
```

#### 2. **LATERAL Joins for Complex Parsing**
```sql
-- Parse complex JSON structures
SELECT 
    campaign_id,
    f.value:keyword::STRING as keyword,
    f.value:bid::NUMBER as bid_amount,
    f.value:quality_score::NUMBER as quality_score
FROM campaigns,
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => keywords_json) f
WHERE f.value:status = 'ACTIVE';
```

#### 3. **Conditional Aggregation**
```sql
-- Multiple metrics in one query
SELECT 
    campaign_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_days,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN cost > 100 THEN 1 END) as high_spend_days,
    AVG(CASE WHEN day_of_week = 'Monday' THEN cost END) as monday_avg_cost,
    SUM(CASE WHEN conversion_rate > 0.05 THEN conversions ELSE 0 END) as high_cvr_conversions
FROM campaign_daily_metrics
GROUP BY campaign_id;
```
